# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). The project version
(`pyproject.toml`) tracks the installer; individual skills carry their own
`version` in `meta.yaml`, noted below.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `logging` skill (0.1.0) — guidance for adding and reviewing application
  logging following the OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet.
- `code-smells` skill (0.1.0) — reviews pending changes for code smells
  (refactoring.guru catalog) and suggests refactorings.
- `dependency-review` skill (0.1.0) — reviews dependency/lockfile changes for
  known vulnerabilities and supply-chain risk (OWASP A06, ASVS V15).
- `test-review` skill (0.1.0) — reviews pending changes for adequate, meaningful
  test coverage and flags weak, misleading, or flaky tests.

### Changed

- **Renamed the project `skillful` → `skilldeck`** to avoid a PyPI name
  collision with an unrelated package. The distribution, `import` package, and
  console command are all now `skilldeck` (e.g. `uvx skilldeck`,
  `skilldeck list`).
- `security-review` skill (0.1.0 → 0.2.0) — review checklist realigned to the
  OWASP ASVS 5.0 categories (V1–V16) with assurance levels (L2 default); findings
  now include an ASVS category.

## [0.1.0]

### Added

- Initial `skilldeck` CLI: `list`, `install`, `uninstall`.
- Agent adapters for Claude, Codex, and Kiro.
- `security-review` skill (0.1.0).
