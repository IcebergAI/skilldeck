# Dependency Review

Review the **dependency changes on the current branch** — packages added,
upgraded, downgraded, or removed — for known vulnerabilities and supply-chain
risk. This covers OWASP Top 10
[A06:2021 Vulnerable and Outdated Components](https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/)
and ASVS V15 (Secure Coding & Architecture); pair it with `security-review` for
the rest of the application surface.

## Scope

1. Determine the diff: `git diff <base>...HEAD` (default base: `main`/`master`),
   plus any uncommitted or untracked changes. If you are already on the base
   branch, review the uncommitted changes instead.
2. Focus on dependency manifests and lockfiles, e.g.:
   - JS/TS — `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - Python — `pyproject.toml`, `requirements*.txt`, `uv.lock`, `poetry.lock`
   - Go — `go.mod`, `go.sum`; Rust — `Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`
   - Java — `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`; Ruby — `Gemfile`, `Gemfile.lock`
   - Containers — `Dockerfile` base images; CI — pinned action/tool versions
3. Diff old vs new versions to see exactly what changed. If automated tooling is
   available (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `osv-scanner`, `govulncheck`,
   `cargo audit`, `gh` advisory APIs), run it and cite the results; otherwise
   reason from the version changes and known advisories.

## What to look for

- **Known vulnerabilities** — does an added or upgraded package (or a transitive
  dependency pulled in by the lockfile change) have a CVE/GHSA advisory? Does the
  resolved version fall in the affected range? Is the fix available in a later
  release?
- **Outdated / unmaintained** — a pinned version far behind upstream, or a
  package with no recent releases and no active maintainers.
- **Supply-chain red flags**:
  - **Typosquatting / confusion** — a name suspiciously close to a popular
    package, or an internal name resolvable from a public index (dependency
    confusion).
  - **Provenance** — source switched to a fork, a git URL, or a non-canonical
    registry; install/postinstall scripts newly introduced.
  - **Trust footprint** — a new direct dependency that pulls a large transitive
    tree, or a tiny utility added for trivial functionality.
- **Version hygiene** — unpinned or loosened ranges (`*`, `latest`, `^`/`~`
  where exact pins are the norm here); a lockfile change with no corresponding
  manifest change (or vice versa); a downgrade that re-introduces a fixed CVE.
- **Licensing** — a new dependency under a license incompatible with the
  project's (e.g. GPL pulled into a permissively-licensed codebase).
- **Integrity** — missing or changed lockfile hashes/checksums.

## Output

Report each finding as a single list item:

- **[severity] advisory ID or concern** — `package old→new`
  **Issue:** the advisory (CVE/GHSA) and affected range, or the specific
  supply-chain concern; note whether the package is a direct or transitive dependency.
  **Fix:** upgrade to the patched version, pin, swap package, or remove; note if no
  fixed version exists yet.

`severity` reflects exposure: **critical** — an advisory that is known-exploited
or critical in the resolved version range, or a clear malicious-package signal;
**high** — a high-severity advisory, or a serious provenance concern (fork or
git source, newly introduced install scripts); **medium** — outdated or
unmaintained packages, loosened pins, lockfile drift; **low** — hygiene and
licensing nits. The classifier is the advisory ID (e.g. `CVE-2024-12345`,
`GHSA-…`) or the supply-chain concern (e.g. `Typosquatting`); the location slot
names the package and its version change instead of a `file:line`. Order
findings by severity, highest first, and keep one issue per finding. For example:

- **[high] Provenance** — `left-pad 1.3.0→git+https://github.com/someuser/left-pad`
  **Issue:** the dependency now resolves to a personal fork instead of the
  registry release, so its contents can change without a version bump and bypass
  registry review. Direct dependency.
  **Fix:** pin back to the registry release, or vendor the fork at a reviewed
  commit hash.

**Never cite an advisory ID you have not verified** from tool output or a
fetched advisory page — do not reproduce CVE/GHSA numbers from memory. If you
cannot verify, describe the concern and state that advisory lookup was not
possible.

Open the report with one line stating what was reviewed and the outcome, e.g.
`Reviewed main..HEAD (2 manifests): 1 finding, high.` If the dependency changes
are clean, say so explicitly. If the diff touches no dependencies, state that
rather than reviewing application code — pair with `security-review` for that.
